Configuration files for vim, bash, etc.

This is just a way to easily access my configuration files online. Most settings are presumably not very special. However, even if the customizations are little, I like to play around with virtual machines and I want to keep my settings on all virtual machines in sync such that vim, bash (or zsh) have the same look / behavior.
