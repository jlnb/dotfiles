# dotfiles
Configuration files for vim, bash, etc.

This is just a way to easily access my configuration files online. Most settings are presumably not very special. However, even if the customizations are little, I like to play around with virtual machines and I want to keep my settings on all virtual machines in sync such that vim, bash (or zsh) have the same look / behavior.

## To-do on new machines

* Clone this repository
* Install fonts located in the fonts folder (optional)
* Make sure the terminal uses these fonts (optional)
* Make sure **zsh** is installed
* Make sure **oh-my-zsh** is installed
* Make sure **powerlevel10k** theme is available
* Create symbolic links from the dotfiles in this repository to the correct places on the machine

Even though points two and three are indicated as optional, it is recommended to install the font and use it in the terminal app.
