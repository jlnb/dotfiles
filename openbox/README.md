* Shortcuts to place windows added
    * A-<k>, <k> beeing q, w, e, a, s, d, y, x, c
    * Window is placed accordings to the (relative) position on the keyboard,
      i.e. q places the currently active window in the top left corner, c in
      the lower left corner and so on (note: s maximizes the current window to
      use the whole space on one desktop)

The rest of the 'rc.xml' file is not changed (yet) and corresponds to the
standard after installing archlabs.
